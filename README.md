This repository contains an ecomm website project completed during my manual testing training. The projects were completed using a combination of manual testing techniques and test management tools.
The tools used for this purpose were JIRA and Zephyr. 
The aim of the project was to test the web application for its functionality and usability.
This can be further extended to also develop automated test cases 

Templates for this project include:
1. Functional requirement specification
2. Test Plan
3. Test environment
4. Test Scenarios
5. Test Cases
6. RTM
7. Test execution result
8. Bug report
